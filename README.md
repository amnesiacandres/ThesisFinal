ThesisFinal
===========

Final iteration of my PhD dissertation document.


This change was done from laptop, and pushed into github.

Now, the local copy was moved from home directory to Dropbox directory, I hope this doesn mess things up in a perpetual sync...
It works!



File structure

chapters/chX... - Chapter files, are separated to reduce complexity at debugging.

biblio.bib - contains the bibliography for ALL chapters in BibTex format.

refs/.. - Reference files including copies or links to the files in the bibliography. This is ignored by the git repo.
